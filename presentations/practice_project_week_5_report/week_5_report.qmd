### Where were we?

Decision time!

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 75%;"}
Weighed up pros and cons of the two choices

::: {.column width="50%" }
Thermally stable biopolymers

::: {.column width="50%" }
Pros

::: {.nonincremental }
- More ethical applications
- Plentiful data
- Methods seem more modern
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%" }
Cons

::: {.nonincremental }

- Not much expert support
- Less sense of direction
- More complex domain space

:::

::: {.column width="50%" }

High-entropy alloys (HEAs)

::: {.column width="50%" }

Pros

::: {.nonincremental}
- More expert input
- Clearer direction for experiments
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%" }

Cons

::: {.nonincremental }
- Less data and code
- Not as ethical in applications
- Methods less exciting

### Thermally stable biopolymers

::: {.fragment}
Definitions

::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
- Thermally stable -> Capable of resisting prolonged high temperatures with minimal degradation
- Polymer -> A substance composed of macromolecules, we are interested in plastic-like polymers
- Biopolymers -> Polymers made of natural / biodegradade materials that easily break down under certain conditions

###  What we've been up to

::: {.nonincremental style="font-size: 65%;"}
- Finished explorative literature review
- Created a guidance sheet on relevant chemistry knowledge
- Collected a set of datasets and code to explore
- Developed a rough timeline and set of deadlines for project planning
- Got further guidance on understanding graphs with Alex

### Talk with Katie

::: {.nonincremental}
- Found our specific application -> Food packaging
- Decided on properties of interest to predict on
- Restricted the scope of project outcome
- Validated project management approach
- Putting us in touch with her colleague Sandeep
:::


---

### Plan going forward

::: {.nonincremental}
- Start simple and build up, consolidate chemistry knowledge
- Learn the intricacies of graphs networks
- Put together a user journey to fully inform business understanding
- Initially just model properties of interest, potentially expand to 3D structures
- Consulting experts when anticipating hurdles
:::

### Challenges

- Very open project in terms of direction
- Cannot independently model properties related to thermal stability, degradation is equally important
- Balancing time for other priorities

---

### Any questions?
